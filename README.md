# Java-Project

Spring Boot application that utilizes the Employee entity to perform CRUD operations through REST APIs.

GET Mapping: Retrieving employee data using different parameters such as ID, name, or a combination of ID and name. 
POST Mapping: Inserting new employee record into the system. 
UPDATE Operation: Updating existing employee details based on specific criteria. 
DELETE Operation: Removing employee records from the database as needed. Additionally, to provide a user-friendly interface, I have Integrated Thymeleaf, a templating engine, to showcase the output in a visually appealing manner and also I have used Bootstrap for CSS framework.
